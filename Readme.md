# Compiler of the Java-- language to Java Bytecodes

## How to compile
To compile the code you simply have to run the script *compile.sh* in the root directory.

## How to run
There are two ways to run the program:
    * run the *run.sh* script in the root directory. This script can take an optional argument that indicates the input_file. If the argument is not specified, the program will take a default input file.
    * execute the command *java jmm [-r=<num>] [-o] <input_file.jmm>* in the src directory.
